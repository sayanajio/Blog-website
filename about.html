            <p class="text-jus">Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is an Indian multinational information technology (IT) services and
                consulting company headquartered in Mumbai.[6][7] It is a part of the Tata Group and operates in 149
                locations across 46 countries.[8]

                TCS is the second largest Indian company by market capitalisation and is among the most valuable IT
                services brands worldwide.[9][10][11] In 2015, TCS was ranked 64th overall in the Forbes World's Most
                Innovative Companies ranking, making it both the highest-ranked IT services company and the top Indian
                company.[12] As of 2018, it is ranked eleventh on the Fortune India 500 list.[13] In April 2018, TCS
                became the first Indian IT company to reach $100 billion in market capitalisation[14] and second Indian
                company ever (after Reliance Industries achieved it in 2007)[15] after its market capitalisation stood
                at ₹6.793 trillion (equivalent to ₹7.7 trillion or US$100 billion in 2020) on the Bombay Stock
                Exchange.[16][17][18]

                In 2016–2017, parent company Tata Sons owned 72.05% of TCS[19] and more than 70% of Tata Sons' dividends
                were generated by TCS.[20] In March 2018, Tata Sons sold stocks of TCS worth $1.25 billion in a bulk
                deal.[21] As of 15 September 2021, TCS has recorded a market capitalisation of US$200 billion, making it
                the first Indian IT firm to do so.[22]</p>
