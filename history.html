                1968–2005
                Tata Consultancy Services Limited, initially started as "Tata Computer Systems" was founded in 1968 by
                division of Tata Sons Limited.[23] Its early contracts included punched card services to sister company
                TISCO (now Tata Steel), working on an Inter-Branch Reconciliation System for the Central Bank of
                India,[24] and providing bureau services to Unit Trust of India.

                In 1975, TCS delivered an electronic depository and trading system called SECOM for Swiss company SIS
                SegaInterSettle; it also developed System X for the Canadian Depository System and automated the
                Johannesburg Stock Exchange.[25] TCS associated with a Swiss partner, TKS Teknosoft, which it later
                acquired.[26]

                In 1980, TCS established India's first dedicated software research and development centre, the Tata
                Research Development and Design Centre (TRDDC) in Pune.[27] In 1981, it established India's first
                client-dedicated offshore development centre, set up for clients Tandem. TCS later (1993) partnered with
                Canada-based software factory Integrity Software Corp, which TCS later acquired.

                In anticipation of the Y2K bug and the launch of a unified European currency (Euro), Tata Consultancy
                Services created the factory model for Y2K conversion and developed software tools which automated the
                conversion process and enabled third-party developer and client implementation.[28] Towards the end of
                1999, TCS decided to offer Decision Support System (DSS) in the domestic market under its Corporate Vice
                President and Transformation Head Subbu Iyer.[29]

                platforms and SaaS platforms.
